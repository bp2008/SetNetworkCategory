# SetNetworkCategory
Lists the Network adapters on Windows and allows you to see and set the firewall category of each between "Public", "Private", and "Domain" modes.

This app exists because Windows often does not allow you to change the network mode from "public" to "private" via a graphical interface, and you are forced to use Powershell or the Registry instead.  Well, now there is a simple app to let you make this change.  Download from the [releases](https://github.com/bp2008/SetNetworkCategory/releases) section.  No installation required.  It just uses .NET Framework 4.7.2.
